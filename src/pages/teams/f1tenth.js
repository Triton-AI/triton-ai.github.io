              Triton AI has proudly competed in the <strong>Autonomous Karting Series (AKS)</strong>, a premier collegiate tournament hosted annually at Purdue University. The competition brings together top engineering institutions, including Purdue, UC Berkeley, and UC Riverside, to push the limits of autonomous driving technology on 1:1 scale electric go-karts.

            <p>
              At Triton AI, we are advancing the limits of autonomous mobility with our custom-designed electric go-kart, equipped with state-of-the-art sensors such as depth-sensing cameras, GPS/IMU systems, and LiDAR. These technologies allow us to develop and refine cutting-edge autonomous driving techniques, from perception and localization to planning and control, under the same real-world conditions faced by industry.

            <h2>Designed from the Ground Up</h2>
            <p>
              Each team in AKS designs and builds its kart from the ground up, integrating perception, planning, and control systems to navigate a challenging, high-speed track autonomously. Teams are judged based on the speed of their autonomous laps, as well as how quickly and effectively their vehicles can maneuver around obstacles on the course.

            The series serves as a proving ground for our engineering decisions and offers an opportunity to benchmark our platform against some of the top robotics programs in the country. For Triton AI, AKS is more than a race, it is an opportunity to showcase innovation, learn from peer institutions, and remain on the leading edge of autonomous vehicle research.
          </p>
          <p>
            As our team continues to grow, we remain committed to pushing the boundaries of autonomy and contributing to the future of intelligent mobility.
